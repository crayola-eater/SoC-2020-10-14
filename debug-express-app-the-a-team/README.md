# Debugging ðŸ§¯ðŸ¦Ÿ

Here we have a jokes API to keep track of all the fantastic one liners bootcampers share with each other. The code has some bugs in it and our job is to fix them all.

## Order to do things in

- get your env variables and put them in a `.env` just like in `.env.example`
- run the create table script
- send a post request to create a new joke
- send a get request to get the joke by the id
- add more jokes
- send a get request to get all jokes

## Bonus

- create new routes to perform other crud operations.
- create a script to drop the table
